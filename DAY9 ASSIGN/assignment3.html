"On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has breached the previous swing low of 19,333 it touched in the first week of October and has closed below that, indicating a breakdown. Weekly, daily and hourly momentum indicators have a negative crossover, a sell signal. Thus, both price and momentum indicators are suggesting a further decline. On the downside, Nifty is likely to drift towards 19,000 from a short term perspective. On the way up, 19,500 - 19,530 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone as per the principle of role reversal," said Jatin Gedia, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.<br><br>GREATER NOIDA, India Jan 11 (Reuters) - Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) plans to expand its electric car portfolio with new models and higher price points, its managing director said on Wednesday, as it looks to cement its lead as the top selling electric vehicle (EV) company in India.

The carmaker will also offer a choice of ranges for its EVs so it can address the needs of multiple buyers, including shorter ranges for city use, Shailesh Chandra, managing director of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and its EV subsidiary told Reuters on the sidelines of India's Auto Expo car show.<br><br>"Customer needs are getting very individualistic. Going ahead we will maintain our growth momentum and work towards further strengthening our portfolio," said Chandra.

The company showcased 12 cars, including five electric models, and 14 trucks, including ones powered by hydrogen fuel cells, as it looks to deepen its clean vehicle push.

The cars included electric versions of its popular Harrier and Sierra SUVs as well as a concept car based on its new electric vehicle platform which is expected to be launched in late 2025, Chandra said.
